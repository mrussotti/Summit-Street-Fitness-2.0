# Progress

After many months of beginner gains, you will start to reach a plateau. Your lifts won't be improving and you will feel like you are doing something wrong. You have now reached the **intermediate lifting level**. It's important to adjust your training program to continue making progress. This may involve incorporating more advanced techniques such as periodization, progressive overload, and accessory exercises.

## Periodization

Periodization involves cycling through different training phases to prevent plateaus and promote continued progress.

## Progressive Overload

Progressive overload involves gradually increasing the weight or reps of your lifts to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.

## Accessory Exercises

Accessory exercises can help to target specific muscle groups and improve weaknesses.

It's also important to continue focusing on proper form and technique to prevent injury and maximize results. By staying consistent and making adjustments to your training program, you can continue to make progress and reach your goals.
