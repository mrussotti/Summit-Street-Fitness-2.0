Gym etiquette is essential for a safe and respectful workout environment. When using equipment, it is important to wipe it down with disinfectant after use to prevent the spread of germs. Additionally, if someone is waiting for a machine, offer to let them work in with you or complete your set quickly. When using the mirrors, be aware of your surroundings and give others space to use them too. Don't hog the mirror, and avoid blocking other people's view. Overall, being mindful of others and their needs can make the gym a more enjoyable and productive place for everyone.
