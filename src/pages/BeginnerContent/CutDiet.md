
Cutting is the process of losing body fat while maintaining muscle mass by consuming fewer calories than you burn and focusing on strength training and cardio. This guide will cover the basic concepts and techniques to help beginner lifters successfully cut.

## Nutrition

### Caloric Intake
- **Maintain a caloric deficit**: Aim for a caloric deficit of around 20-25% below your maintenance level. This allows you to lose fat while preserving muscle.

### Macronutrients
- **Protein**: Consume 1.0-1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily to support muscle retention.
- **Carbohydrates**: Carbs fuel your workouts and aid recovery. Aim for a moderate intake, around 30-40% of your daily calories.
- **Fats**: Healthy fats are essential for overall health. Aim for around 25-35% of your daily calories.

## Training

### Resistance Training
- **Focus on compound lifts**: Incorporate compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and overhead press in your routine.
- **Maintain intensity**: Keep the weight heavy but reduce the volume of your training to maintain strength and muscle mass.
- **Training frequency**: Aim for 3-5 lifting sessions per week, focusing on full-body workouts or a body part split (e.g., push/pull/legs).

### Cardio
- **Incorporate regular cardio**: Include 3-5 cardio sessions per week to support fat loss, focusing on a mix of low-intensity steady-state (LISS) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT).

## Recovery

### Sleep
- **Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep**: Prioritize sleep to support muscle recovery and overall health.

### Rest Days
- **Schedule rest days**: Give your muscles time to recover by including 1-2 rest days per week, depending on your training intensity.

### Listen to your body
- **Adjust your training and nutrition**: If you feel fatigued or notice a decline in performance, adjust your training volume, intensity, or caloric intake accordingly.

By following these guidelines, beginner lifters can achieve a successful cutting phase, losing body fat while maintaining muscle mass and strength.
