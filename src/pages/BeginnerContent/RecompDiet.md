
Body recomposition, or "recomping," is the process of simultaneously losing body fat and gaining muscle mass. This guide will cover the basic concepts and techniques to help beginner lifters achieve a successful body recomp.

## Nutrition

### Caloric Intake
- **Maintain a slight caloric deficit**: Aim for a caloric deficit of around 10-20% below your maintenance level. This allows you to lose fat while providing enough energy for muscle growth.

### Macronutrients
- **Protein**: Consume 1.0-1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily to support muscle growth.
- **Carbohydrates**: Carbs fuel your workouts and aid recovery. Aim for a moderate intake, around 40-50% of your daily calories.
- **Fats**: Healthy fats are essential for overall health. Aim for around 20-30% of your daily calories.

## Training

### Resistance Training
- **Focus on compound lifts**: Incorporate compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and overhead press in your routine.
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase the weight or volume of your training to continually challenge your muscles.
- **Training frequency**: Aim for 3-5 lifting sessions per week, focusing on full-body workouts or an upper/lower body split.

### Cardio
- **Incorporate moderate cardio**: Include 2-3 cardio sessions per week to support fat loss, focusing on low to moderate intensity activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.

## Recovery

### Sleep
- **Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep**: Prioritize sleep to support muscle recovery and growth.

### Rest Days
- **Schedule rest days**: Give your muscles time to recover by including 2-3 rest days per week, depending on your training intensity.

### Listen to your body
- **Adjust your training and nutrition**: If you feel fatigued or notice a decline in performance, adjust your training volume, intensity, or caloric intake accordingly.

By following these guidelines, beginner lifters can achieve a successful body recomposition, losing body fat while gaining muscle mass.
