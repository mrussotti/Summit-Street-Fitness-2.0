For beginners in the gym, starting slow and gradually building up intensity is key. A good starting point is to go 2-4 times a week, allowing for rest and recovery between sessions. In terms of intensity, a good rule of thumb is to aim for 2-5 RIR (reps in reserve), meaning you stop a few reps shy of failure. Compound lifts such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows should be prioritized over isolation exercises. Proper form and technique should be the focus, rather than lifting heavy weights. As you progress and become more comfortable with your training, you can gradually increase intensity and frequency to continue making progress.
