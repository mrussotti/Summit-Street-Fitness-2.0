Gaining and losing weight is largely a matter of creating a calorie surplus or deficit. To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than you burn through exercise and daily activities. For example, if your body requires 2,000 calories per day to maintain your current weight, consuming an additional 500 calories per day would result in a weekly weight gain of approximately 1 pound. Conversely, to lose weight, you need to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than you burn. For example, reducing your daily intake by 500 calories would result in a weekly weight loss of approximately 1 pound. It's important to note that weight gain and loss is not just about calorie intake, but also the quality of the foods you eat and the type of exercise you do.
